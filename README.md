â€¢	Vitamin B6: Known for its ability to reduce nerve pain, Vitamin B6 also supports nerve cell health and helps maintain proper neurotransmitter function.

â€¢	Benfotiamine: A more bioavailable form of thiamine, benfotiamine is highly effective in supporting nerve health, reducing pain, and enhancing circulation compared to regular thiamine.

â€¢	Turmeric (Curcumin): A natural anti-inflammatory compound that helps reduce nerve pain and inflammation while promoting overall nerve healing and regeneration.

â€¢	Folinic Acid: A bioavailable form of folate, folinic acid helps support nerve regeneration and promotes cell growth and repair.
